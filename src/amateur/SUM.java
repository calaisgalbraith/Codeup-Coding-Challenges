//Write a function that returns the SUM of a sequence of numbers.
// This sequence is determined by three variables: start, finish, and step.
// The sequence begins at start, ends at finish, and goes up by step until it reaches
// finish or a number that when increased by step would go past finish.

//ex:
//Input: start: 1 finish: 4 step: 1 | Output: 10
//Input: start: 4 finish: 10 step: | Output: 13
